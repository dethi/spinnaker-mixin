# Prometheus Metrics

The Spinnaker services can expose Prometheus metrics on
`*:<service_port>/aop-prometheus` when using the [Armory Observability
Plugin](https://github.com/armory-plugins/armory-observability-plugin).

These metrics enable operators to observe how it is performing. For example
how many pipelines have been triggered, any errors with cloud providers, rate of
requests between services.

These metrics can be scraped by a Prometheus server and viewed in Prometheus,
displayed on a Grafana dashboard and/or trigger alerts to Slack/etc.

## Prometheus Mixin

A Prometheus mixin bundles all of the metric related concerns into a single
package for users of the application to consume.
Typically this includes dashboards, recording rules, alerts and alert logic
tests.

By creating a mixin, application maintainers and contributors to the project
can enshrine knowledge about operating the application and supply Service
Level Objectives that users may wish to use.

For more background see the [monitoring-mixins](https://github.com/monitoring-mixins/docs)
project on GitHub.

## Scraping the metrics manually

Assuming Spinnaker has been installed into Kubernetes and the plugin has been
installed you can access the metrics via Kubernetes port-forward to your pod:

```
$ kubectl port-forward orca-6786f98464-ckml8 8083 &
[1] 293283
```

Then query the metrics endpoint:

```
$ curl localhost:7002/metrics

<snip>

```

## Scraping metrics with the Prometheus Operator

The [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator)
supports a couple of Kubernetes native scrape target `CustomResourceDefinitions`.

This project includes a [PodMonitor](podmonitor.yaml) CRD definition that by
default will scrape all `Pods` with the annotation `prometheus.io/scrape= "true"` on
port `8008`.

The scrape port is different from the plugins default (Service API port)
because if we apply the [Principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege)
then Prometheus shouldn't have access to the Spinnaker API's. It doesn't need
it. See the plugin docs for changing the port to `8008` or something else.

If you would like to scrape each services default port then you can use the
included `PodMonitor` as a base and duplicate per application, modifying the
the selectors pod labels and target port number each time.

Submit the `PodMonitor` CustomResourceDefinition to Kubernetes API:

```
kubectl apply -f podmonitor.yaml
```

The Prometheus Operator will trigger a reload of Prometheus configuration and
you should see the Spinnaker services in your Prometheus UI under
`Service Discovery` and `Targets`.

## Grafana dashboards

Whilst Grafana dashboards are `json` files this project uses
[jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/) templating language to simplify development and
maintenance of the dashboards.

The [dashboards](./dashboards/) directory contains the jsonnet template files
which must be rendered into json in order to be imported into Grafana.

You can install and use the `jsonnet` tool to render the dashboards or download
the latest [release](https://github.com/uneeq-oss/spinnaker-mixin/releases)
archive which contains rendered json files ready for importing into Grafana.

You may need to edit the datasource if you have configured your Prometheus
datasource with a different name.

## Using the mixin with kube-prometheus

See the [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/coreos/kube-prometheus#kube-prometheus)
project documentation for instructions on importing mixins.

## Using the mixin as raw JSON and YAML files

If you don't use the jsonnet based `kube-prometheus` project then you will need to
generate the raw files or download the latest [release](https://github.com/uneeq-oss/spinnaker-mixin/releases)
archive for inclusion in your Prometheus installation.

To generate the raw files first install the `jsonnet` dependencies:

```
go install github.com/google/go-jsonnet/cmd/jsonnet@latest
go install github.com/google/go-jsonnet/cmd/jsonnetfmt@latest
go install github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler/cmd/jb@latest
jb install
```

Generate with:

```
make
```

Grab the raw files from the `./manifests` directory.

### Iterating with a local Grafana instance

When modifying dashboards it can be useful to have a live Grafana
instance with access to a Prometheus datasource with metric data.

We can run a local Grafana with Docker and thanks to Grafana's
[provisioning](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/#datasources?utm_source=grafana_ds_list)
support we can have it watch for dashboard changes in
`manifests/` and reload them.

Start Grafana listening on `127.0.0.1:3000`:

```
make grafana
```

Expose your Prometheus on `0.0.0.0:9090` or via Kubernetes:

```
kubectl port-forward -n prometheus svc/prometheus-k8s --address 0.0.0.0 9090 &
```

Edit dashboards:

```
vim dashboards/clouddriver.jsonnet
```

Install the `jsonnet` dependencies:

```
go install github.com/google/go-jsonnet/cmd/jsonnet@latest
go install github.com/google/go-jsonnet/cmd/jsonnetfmt@latest
go install github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler/cmd/jb@latest
jb install
```

Render jsonnet to json:

```
make build
```

Check http://localhost:3000 for changes.

### Alert Conventions

Please see the
[monitoring-mixins alert guidelines](https://github.com/monitoring-mixins/docs#guidelines-for-alert-names-labels-and-annotations)
for conventions we follow.

New alerts should generally be accompanied by a relevant unit test in
[tests.yaml](./tests.yaml). Tests help readers understand the alerts purpose and
also catch edge cases.

## Releasing

```
git clone git@github.com:uneeq-oss/spinnaker-mixin.git
cd spinnaker-mixin
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push orign vX.Y.Z
```

GitHub Actions will then build, test and create a new release with an archive
containing rendered yaml and json manifests, including Grafana dashboards.
